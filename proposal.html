                We wanted our visualization to focus on something familiar and accessible to a wide group of people. We, as a group, 
                find the most powerful and interesting visualizations to be those that offer a new, visual
                perspective into a familiar topic. The first part of our topic selection was an exercise in brainstorming and revision.
            </p>
            <p>
                We started looking for interesting data sets. At first, we bounced around. Candidate topics including aggregate spending 
                on space exploration missions, influential hip hop songs, and immigration manifestos from Medieval Europe. 
                All contenders had a similar issue—the data was out of reach. Some datasets were incomplete, others were inaccessible, and
                some were just not what they claimed to be. Many of the datasets that were accessible were rather narrow; the specificity or 
                topic of the dataset provided few ways of tearing that data apart in search of insight, and these few ways usually had two issues:
                either they had been done before (by someone with way more skill than us) or they were not compelling to our group.
            </p>
            <p>
                We re-evaluated our approach. Rather than looking for interesting topics, we looked for interesting data. Almost by accident, 
                we found Wikipedia. The Free Online Encyclopedia was an ideal starting point for data; the site is universally familiar to our 
                projected audience, well-documented with data, and literally encyclopaedic in scope. Wikipedia provides free, no-auth APIs for
                a number of different data streams (e.g. edit history, page views, internal links, etc.). With an initial data source determined,
                we returned to our initial challenge—narrowing a broad field of opportunity into a specific angle for our project.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ultimately selected visual art. Specifically, we're looking at paintings (see our <a href="#scope-note">Optional Features section </a> 
                for a note on that). We all find this topic interesting and imagine the average user is familiar with it, even if they aren't a 
                big art fan. Notable paintings are well-documented on Wikipedia and can be grouped by genre, by artist,
                or by current collection occupancy. Visual art is built around a significant and inherent visual element. We figured that the 
                average user would get value from an interactive tool with a visual nature that mirrors the visual nature of the subject medium.

                We intend our project to be an interactive tool that appeals to both art experts and laymen alike. We want to play into design concepts
                such as space, connection, and color when bringing our visualation of art works and genres to life. Often, we think of artists as  
                sparks of isolated genius whose creative outpouring is neatly summed and encapsulated by a famous name. We think the truth is far messier 
                than that. Artists have always borrowed from their mentors, their predecessors, and their muses. We want our users to 
                see those networks of influence and inspiration as the cultural forces that drive artistic movements. To do this, we plan to use a 
                node-and-edge style visualization. The geographic element is also key; we think a visualization of how art movements evolved in different 
                cities and are now spread across global collections would be an interesting and novel product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Page views are another important pillar of our project. We want to use page views as a loose analague against which we can measure
                the influence and popularity of genres, artworks, or artists within the larger realm of "visual art." If the Impressionism bubble is 
                bigger than the Expressionism bubble, one can infer Expressionism is generally more popular than Impressionism. We hope this aggregate 
                information, though by no means a perfect measures, helps users put a tangible yardstick to the intangible task of measuring art influence.

                We plan to use a variety of datasets and APIs for this project—particularly, we will utilize several Wikipedia APIs and datasets
                from prominent art museums. In order to demonstrate changing popularity in artists or art works over time, we will use 
                Wikipedia Page View statistics as an indicator of interest. Aggregated page views provide an interesting "mile-high" 
                overview of how users interact with art information on Wikipedia. The Page View API we intend to use is described 
                <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews">here</a>. This API will allow us to query for page views by artist,
                museum, or genre within a set timeframe. Though rich in data depth, this single source may be limited in usage. Additional data sources
                are needed to build our unique project goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also would like to visualize connections between art pieces or artists to better demonstrate the body of knowledge surrounding
                a particular page of interest. To do this, we plan to use the Wikipedia Internal Links API linked
                <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Links">here</a> which will allow us to access other linked articles on any Wikipedia page. 
                If we determine that we need to supplement those APIs for additional information, such as museum locations or general 
                metadata, we may look into webscraping Wikipedia articles as well.  
            </p>
            <p>
                To access museum level data, we turn to a variety of datasets from major museums with collection information. Information about current
                collections may also be useful in confirming information about where art works are stored. The museums for which we have located datasets 
                are linked below. There are several limitations and areas of investigation with regards to these data sources that are addressed in our
                <a href="#data-processing-note"> data processing section. </a>
                Additionally, we are aware that these museums only represent a sample of major art collections and we will be clear in the 
                limited scope of museum information represented. We also plan to investigate the Muselia API 
                <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api/muselia-rest-api">Muselia API</a>. This API provides a global directory of museums that would be 
                useful to provide supplemental museum information in the museum view of the project.

                Most of our data comes from APIs. Because we plan to use multiple APIs, we will need to cross reference data input sources.
                We must also ensure each of those input sources is consistent and robust in the nature of data it supplies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The quality of our data will depend on the quality of the APIs we use and our ability to successfully query those APIs. 
                We have identified a few APIs that we will use, such as the Wikipedia page view and internal link APIs and the published 
                APIs for major museums like the Rijksmuseum and the MoMA. The Wikipedia API requires no token and we have successfully 
                run sample queries. The MoMA and Rijksmuseum have published extensively about their open-source APIs online, so we do 
                not anticipate challenges in accessing that data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span id="data-processing-note">We have also identified a type of API</span> that we would like to use, if the actual APIs of that type prove to be accessible
                and robust enough. Many museums have an API that is publicly accessible, but we have not yet investigated all of those
                APIs to ensure they accurately provide information that we would find meaningful. Some museums might have APIs, but we 
                don’t know if we can access them—It may be that an institution only grants access tokens of an appropriate type to museum 
                members or specific academic partners. Furthermore, many museums don’t have APIs at all. In fact, it seems that it is mostly
                American, British, and Dutch museums that do have APIs. This would be a severe limiting factor on the data we can source. 
                There are third-party museum collection APIs like Muselia, but we are not yet sure how good those services actually are. 
                When working with outside data, one must contend with factors outside of his control. Our plans in this area require a 
                degree of flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once data is pulled in from APIs, we will need to use a combination of dictionaries and cross referencing functions to
                combine multiple sources of input. Wikipedia data related to page view and internal links shouldn’t be too difficult to
                cross reference and compile, given that such data come from a common source and should share schema similarities. Things
                may get more complicated when we deal with works of art from multiple sources, especially when the works of art in
                question might have titles or meta-data with multiple accepted translations into English. We may need to get creative when 
                checking for duplicate art works, or build in some way to tolerate that fault. Ultimately, we need a mix of categorical, 
                geographical, and quantitative data. We plan to use a mix of visualizations to accommodate this diversity of data type. 
                In general, I much prefer to do this sort of work in Python; we might be able to run some auxiliary Python scripts depending
                on how we host and deploy our app.
            </p>
            <p>
                If API and data conversions prove to be problematic, we can use a smaller subset of static data. With this approach, we 
                would query many of the same APIs and manually convert the dataset be build into json format. This would enable a much 
                higher degree of control, and given that many of our data points (page views in a given year, permanent collection location, 
                artist hometown, etc.) are static entities, it wouldn’t take too much out of our project. It would likely require narrowing 
                our focus from a wide dataset of many artists and art pieces to a more narrow dataset of one group of artists or a few specific 
                movements. Such a narrowing could even offer benefits in the form of a more streamlined and reliable final project.

                We consider one of our most crucial features to be one or two quantity visualizations 
                that represent page view metrics.  This visualization would be based on data from the Page View API for the 
                Wikipedia page of a particular artist, art piece, or movement.  We want this visualization to be interactive so 
                that users can change the timeframe these statistics are being sourced from.

            <p>
                Beyond that, we want to incorporate a

                These landmarks will include locations of current artwork if it exists in one the datasets of the museums we support.  
                We will show that data on the movement level (displaying the locations of all artwork we have access to for a particular movement) or 
                artist level (location of art from particular artist) based on user selections.

                If we have the time and ability, we would like to show major museums supported by the project as nodes on our map.  
                These nodes would ideally have mouseover tooltips with additional museum data and general information.  
                Additionally, we would like to investigate adding supplemental artist level views such as visualizations 
                for artist timelines and comparisons between different artists.

                We hope to be able to use the Wikipedia Internal Links API to some extent but we do not consider a visualization based in that data to be a must-have.  
                However, we do think it would be interesting to use that API to check for internal links between artists 
                (checking if one artist links to another, etc) or to display relevant links from the page for an artist or movement.

                <span id="scope-note">Our current topic focus is "visual art."</span> We will start with paintings, as they are often the most well-documented and 
                genre-segmented works of visual art. Painting has the additional benefit of being a concrete artifact, unlike photography or 
                video which often exists in a primarily digital state. Concrete artifacts suit our purpose because they reside in a physical collection,
                and that collection can be plotted as a point on a map. If our painting-visualization method generalizes well, we plan to extend it
                to sculpture, ceramics, or other forms of concrete visual art. We don't know enough about what our process will look like yet to 
                guarantee that funcitonality.

            <p>
                Week Four:  Finalize data collection from all sources.  Finish styling the page and visualizations.  Add any additional interactive features (tooltips, brushing, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
                Final Weeks: Polish existing visualizations and explore optional features if time allows.

               At this point in the process, we have not identified any specific visualizations or designs from which we draw inspiration.
               General ideas were sourced from example process books and visualizations found online at sites such as 
               <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/"> bl.ocks.org. </a>
               While satisfied with our current drafts, we will document any sources of inspiration that we use to refine our ideas.

                Inspiration for our topic came from 
                <a href ="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0"> 
                this spreadsheet </a> of datasets, compiled from the archive of Jeremy Singer-Vine's newsletter "Data is Plural."
                The specific collection of selected datasets, and the direction in which we plan to take them, is entirely original.

                The splash for this site is based off the design for the Wikipedia splash page. The rotating letters are all included in the
                Wikipedia globe logo, and are from the following language orthographies:
                <ul>
                    <li>Roman alphabet (W)</li>
                    <li>Greek alphabet (Ω)</li>
                    <li>Chinese orthography (維)</li>
                    <li>Bengali script (উ)</li>
                    <li>Japanese Katakana (ウィ)</li>
                    <li>Cyrilic alphabet (И)</li>
                    <li>Ethiopian Geʽez (ው)</li>
                    <li>Korean Hangul (위)</li>
