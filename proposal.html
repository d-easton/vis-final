                We wanted our visualization to target something familiar to a wide group of people. We, as a group, 
                find the most powerful and interesting visualizations to be those that offer a new, visual
                perspective into a familiar topic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With this general goal in mind, we started looking for interesting data sets. At first, we bounced around.
                Candidate topics including art museum collections, influential hip hop songs, and immigration manifestos from Medieval Europe. 
                All contenders had a similar issue—the data was out of reach. Some datasets were incomplete, others were inaccessible, and
                some were just not what they claimed to be. Almost by accident, our brainstorming process led us to Wikipedia.
                The Free Online Encyclopedia was the perfect topic; the site is universally familiar to our projected audience, well-documented 
                with data, and literaly encyclopdic in scope. The next task was narrowing a broad field of opportunity into a specific angle
                for our project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Page views provide an interesting "mile-high" view of how users in general interact with Wikipedia. At the aggregate
                level, we saw the opportunity to categorize. We wanted to enable users to find trend insight visual groupings of the article types that tend to be popular on the site (notable people, films, countries, events, etc).
                There are also time-based trends, with current events sometimes driving traffic in a given year or week. One can also observe
                temporal variation in page or topic popularity over Wikipedia's 13 year history.

                We plan to use a variety of datasets and APIs for this project—particularly utilizing several Wikipedia APIs and datasets
                from prominent art museums. In order to demonstrate changing popularity in artists or art works over time, we will use 
                Wikipedia Page View statistics as an indicator of interest. The Page View API we intend to use is described 
                <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews">here</a>. This API will allow us to query for page views by artist,
                museum, or genre within a set timeframe.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We also would like to visualize connections between art pieces or artists or demonstrate the body of knowledge surrounding
                a particular page of interest. To do this, we plan to use the Wikipedia Internal Links API linked
                <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Links">here</a> which will allow us to access other linked articles on any Wikipedia page. 
                If we determine that we need to supplement those APIs for additional information such as museum locations or general 
                metadata we may look into webscraping wikipedia articles as well.  
            </p>
            <p>
                To access information about where art works are stored and museum level data, we will use a variety of datasets from 
                major museums with collection information. The museums we have located datasets for are linked below. There are several 
                limitations and areas of investigation with regards to these data sources that are addressed in the data processing section. 
                Additionally, we are aware that these museums only represent a sample of major art collections and we will be clear in the 
                limited scope of museum information represented. We also plan to investigate the Muselia API 
                <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api/muselia-rest-api">Muselia API</a>. This API provides a global directory of museums that would be 
                useful to provide supplemental museum information in the museum view of the project.

                Most of our data comes from APIs. Because we plan to use multiple APIs, we will need to cross reference data input sources.
                We must also ensure each of those input sources is consistent and robust in the nature of data it supplies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The quality of our data will depend on the quality of the APIs we use and our ability to successfully query those APIs. 
                We have identified a few APIs that we will use, such as the Wikipedia page view and internal link APIs and the published 
                APIs for major museums like the Rijksmuseum and the MoMA. The Wikipedia API requires no token and we have successfully 
                run sample queries. The MoMA and Rijksmuseum have published extensively about their open-source APIs online, so we do 
                not anticipate challenges in accessing that data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We have also identified a type of API that we would like to use, if the actual APIs of that type prove to be accessible
                and robust enough. Many museums have an API that is publicly accessible, but we have not yet investigated all of those
                APIs to ensure they accurately provide information that we would find meaningful. Some museums might have APIs, but we 
                don’t know if we can access them—It may be that an institution only grants access tokens of an appropriate type to museum 
                members or specific academic partners. Furthermore, many museums don’t have APIs at all. In fact, it seems that it is mostly
                American, British, and Dutch museums that do have APIs. This would be a severe limiting factor on the data we can source. 
                There are third-party museum collection APIs like Muselia, but we are not yet sure how good those services actually are. 
                When working with outside data, one must contend with factors outside of his control. Our plans in this area require a 
                degree of flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once data is pulled in from APIs, we will need to use a combination of dictionaries and cross referencing functions to
                combine multiple sources of input. Wikipedia data related to page view and internal links shouldn’t be too difficult to
                cross reference and compile, given that such data come from a common source and should share schema similarities. Things
                may get more complicated when we deal with works of art from multiple sources, especially when the works of art in
                question might have titles or meta-data with multiple accepted translations into English. We may need to get creative when 
                checking for duplicate art works, or build in some way to tolerate that fault. Ultimately, we need a mix of categorical, 
                geographical, and quantitative data. We plan to use a mix of visualizations to accommodate this diversity of data type. 
                In general, I much prefer to do this sort of work in Python; we might be able to run some auxiliary Python scripts depending
                on how we host and deploy our app.
            </p>
            <p>
                If API and data conversions prove to be problematic, we can use a smaller subset of static data. With this approach, we 
                would query many of the same APIs and manually convert the dataset be build into json format. This would enable a much 
                higher degree of control, and given that many of our data points (page views in a given year, permanent collection location, 
                artist hometown, etc.) are static entities, it wouldn’t take too much out of our project. It would likely require narrowing 
                our focus from a wide dataset of many artists and art pieces to a more narrow dataset of one group of artists or a few specific 
                movements. Such a narrowing could even offer benefits in the form of a more streamlined and reliable final project.

                We consider one of our most crucial features to be one or two quantity visualizations 
                that represent page view metrics.  This visualization would be based on data from the Page View API for the 
                Wikipedia page of a particular artist, art piece, or movement.  We want this visualization to be interactive so 
                that users can change the timeframe these statistics are being sourced from. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond that, we want to incorporate a 
                geographic visualization that provides varied location data based on a particular data level.  
                These landmarks will include locations of current artwork if it exists in one the datasets of the museums we support.  
                We will show that data on the movement level (displaying the locations of all artwork we have access to for a particular movement) or 
                artist level (location of art from particular artist) based on user selections.

                If we have the time and ability, we would like to show major museums supported by the project as nodes on our map.  
                These nodes would ideally have mouseover tooltips with additional museum data and general information.  
                Additionally, we would like to investigate adding supplemental artist level views such as visualizations

                We hope to be able to use the Wikipedia Internal Links API to some extent but we do not consider a visualization based in that data to be a must-have.  
                However, we do think it would be interesting to use that API to check for internal links between artists 
                (checking if one artist links to another, etc) or to display relevant links from the page for an artist or movement.
